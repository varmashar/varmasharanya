## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

As an Urban planner driven by data analytics, I'm interested in the interface 
between Urban planning and data science and how it can be used to make the right
decisions about real problems. I am very fascinated by the fact that data 
science can be used in all areas of the world. Always driven by passion and 
creativity, I firmly believe that a well-integrated urban environment can help
empower our society. I am looking for opportunities to help develop new skills 
while enhancing my existing skills.

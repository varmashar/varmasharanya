## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Hi, I am Sharanya, a Grad student at UIUC and a proud cat-mom.

As an Urban planner driven by data analytics, I'm interested in the interface 
between Urban planning and data science and how it can be used to make the right
decisions about real problems. I am very fascinated by the fact that data 
science can be used in all areas of the world. Always driven by passion and 
creativity, I firmly believe that a well-integrated urban environment can help
empower our society. I am looking for opportunities to help develop new skills 
while enhancing my existing skills. 

My concentration is in Land-Use and Transportation planning with advanced GIS. 
Being the university gold medalist during my undergraduate studies in
Architecture from Bangalore university, my interest in transportation planning 
began with my undergraduate project on Physical planning. The project involved  decentralization of bus routes to develop equitable and effective public 
transportation systems while optimizing connectivity.
